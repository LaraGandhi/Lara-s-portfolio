# Hi, I'm Lara
Welcome to my ICS3U portfolio. I’ll use this site to post my work and reflections.

## Highlights
- 🔧 Project 1: *Digital Citizenship: Digital Footprint* – *An exploration of how online actions create a lasting digital footprint and how to manage it responsibly.*
- 🧠 Concept I learned: *How important it is to be careful about what I post online and how to protect my privacy.*
- 📝 Blog/Reflection: [Reflection #1](./posts/digital_footprint_reflection.md)

- 🔧 Project 2: *Nameplate* – *A creative project where I designed a personalized nameplate which has my name and other unique items using basic programming tools on Processing.*
- 🧠 Concept I learned: *How to use coordinates, colors, and basic coding to create a visual design.*
- 📝 Blog/Reflection: [Reflection #1](./posts/nameplate_reflection.md)

-🔧 Project 3: *Unit 3: Programming Assignment* – *This assignment involved writing a program that used conditionals and loops to complete a task.*
- 🧠 Concept I learned: *How to use if-statements and loops, and how to fix errors when my code didn’t work the first time.*
- 📝 Blog/Reflection: [Reflection #1](./posts/unit_3_reflection.md) 

🔧 Project 4: *Falling Objects - Grinch Game* – *An interactive game where objects fall from the screen and the player scores points by avoiding them.*
- 🧠 Concept I learned: *Event handling, collision detection, and game logic (such as keyPressed)*
- 📝 Blog/Reflection: [Reflection #1]()

- 🔧 Project 5: *Final Culminating Project - The Detective's Dilemma: A Murder Mystery Game* – *A story-based mystery game where players gather clues, play mini-games, and solve a case.*
- 🧠 Concept I learned: *How to combine the storytelling aspects of the game, using functions, variables, and user input. I also learned how to use new functions to create unique methods and other parts of code that wasn't implemented before (file reader/writer, switch-case).*
