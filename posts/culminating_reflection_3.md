# Repetition Structure

I used repetition structures multiple times during my code, especially for loops, which helps control the game flow during play. In this case, I used it to display and interact with multiple detectives efficiently. Instead of repeating the same code four times, I used a loop.

This loop was used on the character selection screen to draw all detective options and handle interaction. I implemented it this way to reduce duplicated code and make the program easier to update if more detectives are added later. A challenge I encountered was aligning the characters correctly on the screen. I fixed this by using consistent spacing variables (startX and gap) and adjusting them until the layout looked correct and clean.
