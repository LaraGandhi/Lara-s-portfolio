# Variables & Data Tracking

During the planning stage of my murder mystery game, I focused on identifying and organizing the variables needed for my game to function. I used them to manage the game’s state, visuals, and player actions. Variables such as images, scaling values, and strings to track what should be displayed would also be implemented.
For example:

<img width="419" height="92" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6b989aa2-5eed-43d3-a672-5b2b8b2f7f0b" />

These variables were used throughout the program to ensure that images scale correctly on different screens and that text and visuals remain consistent. I implemented them this way to improve flexibility and maintain a clean user interface. One challenge I encountered was text and buttons appearing misaligned when resizing elements. I fixed this by consistently applying scaleX and scaleY whenever positioning UI components.
