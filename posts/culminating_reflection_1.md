# Variables & Data Tracking

During the planning stage of my murder mystery game, I focused on identifying and organizing the variables needed for my game to function. I used them to manage the game’s state, visuals, and player actions. Variables such as images, scaling values, and strings to track what should be displayed would also be implemented.
For example:
<img width="419" height="92" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6b989aa2-5eed-43d3-a672-5b2b8b2f7f0b" />
