# Arrays & Data Structures

I have implemented many arrays in my code, which allow the game to manage multiple images and pieces of information efficiently.
An example of arrays is the detectives image array:

<img width="302" height="151" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5c3d2857-06b5-4528-96a3-c1fb70acac61" />

This array was used when displaying detective options and character scenes. I implemented arrays so that similar data could be grouped together and accessed using an index, which reduces repetition and improves organization. A challenge I encountered was ensuring the correct image was shown for the selected detective. I fixed this by carefully matching the array index with the selectedDetective variable.
