 # Unit 3: Programming Assignment - In Class

 - Topic(s): This assignment focused on the basic skills of coding on CodeHS. The core programming concepts such as conditional statements, loops, and logical problem-solving was invloved. It required writing code that followed specific instructions and produced correct output.

 - What I struggled with: The hardest part for me was debugging when my code didn’t work as expected. Sometimes the program would run but give the wrong result, which made it difficult to find the issue. I also struggled with understanding how different parts of my code affected each other, especially when using loops and conditions together. Given the short amount of time we had for this project - as it was a one day in class only assignment - I found it hard to get everything done that the assignment was asking me for.

 - What I'm proud of: I’m proud that I learned how to approach debugging more systematically instead of guessing. By testing my code step by step and checking smaller sections at a time, I was able to find and fix errors. Finishing this assignment gave me a better understanding of how logic works in actual java programming.
 
 - Next steps: I want to continue improving my problem-solving and debugging skills by practicing more coding challenges. Reviewing past mistakes and learning from them will help me write cleaner and more efficient code in the future.
