# Selection Structure

I implemented selection structures, specifically if statements that determine which screen or action should occur based on player input and game flow. Selection structures were used in the mousePressed() method to determine what happens when the player clicks a button or selects a detective. For example:

<img width="533" height="136" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/83c9851d-76d5-40f8-a1d2-391b53590516" />

This code was used on the start screen to decide whether the player wants to play the game or view history. I chose this approach because different actions must occur depending on where the player clicks. One challenge I faced was when it seemed that the code was correct but it wasn’t working. I fixed this by adjusting button positions and using else if statements so only one condition could run at a time. I also commented certain parts of the code out to check which part is causing the error.
