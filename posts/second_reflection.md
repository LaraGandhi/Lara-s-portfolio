Topic(s): This project focused on using basic programming concepts to create a visual design. It combined creativity with coding, using coordinates, shapes, and colors to design a personalized digital nameplate.

What I struggled with: I struggled most with positioning and alignment. At times, shapes didn’t appear where I expected them to, which was frustrating. It took trial and error to understand how small changes in coordinates affected the overall design. I also found it challenging to make the design look balanced while still keeping the same as my initial design.

What I’m proud of: I’m proud that I stayed patient and continued adjusting my code until the design looked the way I wanted. I enjoyed being able to add my own creative style and personalize the project. Completing this project helped me feel more confident using basic programming commands and showed me that coding can be both creative and technical.

Next steps: In future projects, I want to focus on writing more efficient and organized code. I plan to practice using variables and calculations more intentionally instead of relying on trial and error to position elements. I also want to comment my code more clearly so it’s easier to understand and debug, especially as projects become more complex.
