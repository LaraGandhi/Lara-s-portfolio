# The Grinch Game - Falling Objects

- Topic(s): This project involved creating an interactive game using programming concepts such as movement, collision detection, scoring systems, and user input

- What I struggled with: I struggled with getting all the moving parts of the game to work together. Collision detection was especially challenging, and small errors sometimes caused the game to behave unpredictably. Managing the score and ensuring the game ran smoothly also required careful attention to detail.

- What I'm proud of: I’m proud that I successfully created a playable game that responds to user input and keeps score correctly. Seeing the game work as intended was very satisfying. This project helped me understand how multiple parts of a program work together.

- Next steps: In the future, I would like to improve the visuals, maybe add sound effects, and introduce new different difficulty levels or a next level option. I also want to continue learning more about game design and user experience.
