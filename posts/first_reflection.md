# Digital Citizenship/Footprint Reflection

- Topic(s): This project focused on digital citizenship, especially understanding digital footprints, online privacy, and responsible internet use.
  
- What I struggled with: The hardest part of this project was making it interesting and engaging. Since the topic was more informational, it was challenging to present it in a way that didn’t feel boring or repetitive. I had to think carefully about how to organize the information and keep the audience’s attention. I also struggled with understanding what a digital footprint is and how permanent it can be. I used to think deleting something online meant it was gone forever, but learning about screenshots, data storage, and online tracking made me realize it’s more complicated than that.
  
- What I’m proud of: I’m proud of how much my perspective changed after this project. I was able to reflect honestly on my own online behavior and explain why digital responsibility matters, not just for now but for the future as well. I also proud of how we engaged the class by doing a fun trivia game.
  
- Next steps: Going forward, I want to apply the steps we looked at in the project into my everyday life by continuing to look at digital footprint and citizenship and keeping an open mind about the things I encounter online.
